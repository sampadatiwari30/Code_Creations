**Code of Conduct — Code_Creations | GSSoC’25 Documentation**

***Our Pledge***

Code_Creations is committed to building a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a respectful and enriching experience for all contributors, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

***Our Standards***

We strive to:
- **Be Friendly and Patient:** Remember that you might be communicating with someone for whom English is a second language, or who may not have the same context or experience level as you. Assume good faith.
- **Be Welcoming:** We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be Respectful:** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disagreement is an opportunity to learn from different perspectives.
- **Be Clear and Concise:** In the spirit of Code_Creations, we value clear, effective communication. Be direct and constructive in your feedback.
- **Take Responsibility for Our Impact:** Our words and actions have consequences. If someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully and apologize sincerely.
